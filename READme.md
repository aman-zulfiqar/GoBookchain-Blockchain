# GoBookchain

GoBookchain is a lightweight, blockchain-powered book checkout system developed in Go. It leverages blockchain principles—immutability, transparency, and tamper resistance—to track book lending records in a secure and verifiable way.

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for integrating blockchain mechanisms into library or inventory management systems, offering a practical demonstration of how decentralized data structures can enhance accountability in traditional systems.

## Overview

GoBookchain utilizes a custom-built blockchain data structure to log and maintain book checkout records. Each checkout transaction is encapsulated as a block, cryptographically linked to the previous block in the chain. This approach ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered without compromising the integrity of the entire chain.

The system also includes a lightweight HTTP API, allowing users to:
- View the full blockchain ledger
- Add new book checkout transactions
- Register new books

## Libraries Used

- **Gorilla Mux**  
  A powerful URL router and dispatcher for building RESTful APIs in Go. It enables clean, readable, and flexible route definitions.

- **crypto/sha256**  
  Provides SHA-256 hashing functions to generate secure cryptographic hashes used to link blocks immutably.

- **crypto/md5**  
  Used to generate unique identifiers for books based on ISBN and publish date, ensuring consistent and deterministic IDs.

- **encoding/json**  
  Used extensively to marshal and unmarshal Go structs to JSON format for API communication and hash generation.

- **net/http**  
  The standard Go HTTP package used to build the REST API server, handle requests, and send responses.

- **log**  
  For structured logging of errors and server activities to aid debugging and monitoring.

- **time**  
  Provides timestamping for blocks, ensuring every transaction is chronologically traceable.

## Features

### Blockchain-Based Ledger
Each book checkout record is added as a block with:
- Unique SHA256 hash
- Timestamp
- Immutable data content
- Reference to the previous block’s hash

### Genesis Block Initialization
The system starts with a genesis block, representing the first transaction in the blockchain. This ensures a stable root for all subsequent records.

### Cryptographic Book ID Generation
Each book record is assigned a unique identifier using the MD5 hash of its ISBN and publish date. This ensures book uniqueness without requiring a centralized database.

### API-Driven Design
RESTful endpoints expose key functionalities:
- `GET /` – View the current blockchain
- `POST /` – Add a new checkout transaction to the chain
- `POST /new` – Register a new book into the system

### Modular Architecture
Code is organized into distinct types and handler functions, promoting readability and maintainability.

## Use Cases

- Library Management: Maintain tamper-proof checkout records for books.
- Academic Institutions: Track borrowing activities by students with integrity and accountability.
- Inventory Checkout Systems: Adaptable for asset tracking in businesses or labs.
- Educational Tool: Demonstrates real-world blockchain implementation using Go, ideal for learning and teaching.

## Advantages

### Immutability & Integrity
Each transaction is cryptographically secured. Once written, a record cannot be changed without invalidating the entire blockchain.

### Transparent and Traceable
All checkouts are visible and verifiable, allowing audit trails for book lending history.

### Lightweight and Fast
Built in Go for efficiency, the system maintains performance without external dependencies like databases or consensus algorithms.

### Simple, Yet Extensible
Though minimal by design, the system can be extended with:
- Persistent storage (e.g., BoltDB, Badger)
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Consensus algorithms for decentralized trust
- User authentication

### Developer-Friendly
Ideal for Go developers wanting to explore blockchain mechanics without diving into complex cryptocurrency stacks. Easily customizable for educational or prototyping purposes.

## Testing

This API has been thoroughly tested using Postman to ensure all endpoints work as expected.
